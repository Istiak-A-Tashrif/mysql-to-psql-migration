MYSQL TO POSTGRESQL MIGRATION LOG
================================================================================
Date: July 15, 2025
Project: Database Migration from MySQL to PostgreSQL
Total Tables: 91 migration scripts

================================================================================
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
================================================================================

âœ… SUCCESSFUL MIGRATIONS: 39 tables
ðŸ“Š TOTAL RECORDS MIGRATED: 37,859+ records
ðŸ”§ MAJOR FIXES IMPLEMENTED: Custom CSV parsing for complex data
ðŸ“ˆ SUCCESS RATE: 43% of tables fully migrated with validated data

================================================================================
MAJOR ACCOMPLISHMENTS
================================================================================

1. CLIENTCONVERSATIONTRACK BREAKTHROUGH
   - Issue: Multi-line message fields breaking CSV parsing
   - Solution: Custom CSV parser with row reconstruction
   - Result: 1,828 records successfully migrated
   - Technical: Modified table_utils.py with import_clientconversationtrack_with_custom_parsing()

2. SYNTAX ERROR RESOLUTION
   - Fixed malformed f-strings across 81+ migration files
   - Corrected broken string literals and regex patterns
   - Implemented automated syntax checking and repair

3. VALIDATION FRAMEWORK
   - Enhanced run_all_migrations_with_validation.py
   - Added record count verification between MySQL and PostgreSQL
   - Categorized failures: script errors vs data validation issues
