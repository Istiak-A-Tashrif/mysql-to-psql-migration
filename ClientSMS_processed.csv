"885","Hi Evan - It's Zee from TC Customs. You have talked recently regarding your inquiry for a vinyl wrap for your 2023 Nissan Altima SV. Every vehicle�s a little different, so we can�t give an exact quote without seeing it in person � but wraps typically start around $2,600. If that ballpark works for you, we can schedule a virtual/in-person consultation to go over everything in detail, or you�re welcome to stop by in person. If not, no worries � we offer other services as well and can help find a way to style your vehicle that fits your budget.","+12293038936","+12485048600","Company","1","127","14","1169","2025-04-23 18:48:57.606","2025-04-23 18:48:57.606"

"1454","Hey Earth apologies for the late reply. I just saw these messages. 30th would most definitely work for us. There is such a thing called satin white ppf. It offers a lot more protection than vinyl wrap. The PPF offers a 10 Year warranty from the manufacturer as opposed to the 3-5 year warranty from the wrap manufacturer. We usually recommend PWF for colored ppf. We usually charge about $9000 for colored ppf but we can do the R8 for $6000 in satin white ppf.","+12293038936","+14707585537","Company","1","123","14","1422","2025-05-09 23:57:55.701","2025-05-09 23:57:55.701"
